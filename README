Scrambler and Image generator
===

Build using ./build.sh.

Usage: Include scrambler.min.js into a HTML file. If you want to use WCA scrambles, provide a suitable TNOODLE_ENV and a function puzzlesLoaded accepts the scramblers from tnoodle and makes them available to the scrambler in window.puzzles whenever they need to be accessed while generating a scramble. Using subset scramblers also requires initialization and setting of a random source.

All code is written and copyrighted by me (Frederik Hutfle√ü), with exception of the contents of the files, where I at most have done very small changes to what the authors originally wrote:
